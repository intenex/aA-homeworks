# To create an LRU Cache you need two data structures
# a Queue implemented with a doubly linked list, and a Hash, fucking amazing
# incredible that you just learned this stuff literally by listening to the lectures
# just listen actively and you can figure it out for sure
# You want to use a hash because a hash has incredibly good read
# and a linked list because linked lists have fantastic insertion and deletion capabilities
# look into how those capabilities work for sure
#

#
# Your version below will be a non-optimized inefficient yet simple version versus linked lists
# which is only more simple because arrays are already implemented and linked lists aren't lol
# since you're pretty sure linked lists are actually way easier to implement and were
# invented first lol
#
# Interesting on arrays in Python https://www.pythoncentral.io/the-difference-between-a-list-and-an-array/
# 
# https://www.rubyguides.com/2017/08/ruby-linked-list/ Creating your own linked list implementation in Ruby interesting
#
# This is such an incredible application of linked lists wow https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/1188
# 
# One random possible implementation of linked lists: https://github.com/spectator/linked-list
